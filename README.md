ZipFile with Bootstrap4

create a Python environment, runserver, and upload a zip file with a few images in it (one level). Created to demonstrate some functionality of ZipFile and to get a bit more familiar with Bootstrap v4. 

More than likely, you should never use such a thing in production - there is no testing of the zip file for malicious files.

When uploading a zip file, there is one to play with in assets.
